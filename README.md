# Synthetic-Datasets
This repository is related to the study: Generative Adversarial Networks vs Large Language Models: A Comparative Study on Synthetic Tabular Data Generation. Provided are the synthetic datasets generated with GPT-4o and CTGAN, and the prompts used to generate the LLM-generated datasets. Each synthetic dataset is generated at the same same sample size as the RWD, and amplified sample size (n = 1000).

These datasets are generated based on the following real-world datasets:

Iris: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
Fish Measurements: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tyjensen/fish-measurements-dataset
Real Estate Valuation: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set
